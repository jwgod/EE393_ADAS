Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)

ADAS are systems developed to automate, adapt and enhance vehicle systems for safety and better driving.

Most safety systems are designed to avoid collisions and accidents by alerting the driver to potential problems, 
or to avoid collisions by implementing safeguards and taking over control of the vehicle.

Some of the most common ADAS features include the adaptive cruise control, automate braking, automate lane keeping
and blind spot detection.

ADAS are one of the fastest-growing segment of the automotive industry.

The US Department of Transportationâ€™s 
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has announced that it will gradually require new vehicles
to have certain ADAS features for safety reasons.
